                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Think about your impressions of the water reservoirs behind them that you have seen. You might have thought of these as oases—providing relief from summer heat and dryness. Well, we all need and use water in our daily lives for drinking, cooking, washing, cleaning, keeping cool, watering gardens and recreational and cultural activities. Water is one of earth’s natural resources and it’s in the things we use and buy every day. We use a lot of water, about 200 liters a person a day (Hans, A., & Bharat, A. 2014), but what would life be like if we had limited water or no water? </p>

                <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;">
                    <div style="width: 70%; margin: auto;">
                        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Water is a finite resource. We live on the driest continent in the world and, as the climate changes, sometimes we have enough water and sometimes we don’t. Up to 70% of water used in schools is lost through leaks. A leaking bubbler wastes 7,000 liters of water every year. (Fecht 2019).  By exploring how we use water and identifying water loss in schools and at home, students recognize why and how we should care for water.</p>

                <h3>Sources of Water</h3>
                <p>There are various sources of water. About 97% of the water on the Earth’s surface is covered with water. National Ground Water Association (n.d.)</p>

                <span>The three main sources of water are:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rainwater – This is collected on Earth in the form of surface water and underground water.</li>
                    <li>Groundwater – This includes water bodies like Wells and Springs.</li>
                    <li>Surface water – This includes different water bodies like Reservoirs, Rivers, Streams, Ponds, Lakes and Tanks.</li>

                    <h3>What is the Water Cycle?</h3>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle or the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth.

                    <h3>Water Cycle Diagram</h3>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">During this process, water changes its state from one phase to another, but the total number of water particles remains the same. In other words, if it were possible to collect and boil 100 gms of water, it will still retain a mass of 100 gms as steam. Likewise, if 100 gms of steam is collected and condensed, the resultant water would still weight 100 gms.</p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Water changes its state through a variety of processes from evaporation, melting and freezing, to sublimation, condensation, and deposition. All these changes require the application of energy.</p>

                    <h3>Stages of Water Cycle</h3>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">There are many processes involved in the movement of water apart from the major steps given in the above water cycle diagram. Listed below are different stages of the water cycle. BYJU'S. (n.d.).</p>

                    <span>1. Evaporation</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The sun is the ultimate source of energy, and it powers most of the evaporation that occurs on earth. Evaporation generally happens when water molecules at the surface of water bodies become excited and rise into the air. These molecules with the highest kinetic energy accumulate into water vapour clouds. Evaporation usually takes place below the boiling point of water. Another process called evapotranspiration occurs when evaporation occurs through the leaves of plants. This process contributes to a large percentage of water in the atmosphere.</p>

                    <span>2. Sublimation</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Sublimation occurs when snow or ice changes directly into water vapour without becoming water. It usually occurs as a result of dry winds and low humidity. Sublimation can be observed on mountain peaks, where the air pressure is quite low. The low air pressure helps to sublimate the snow into water vapour as less energy is utilised in the process. Another example of sublimation is the phase where fog bellows from dry ice. On earth, the primary source of sublimation is from the ice sheets covering the poles of the earth.</p>

                    <span>3. Condensation</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The water vapour that accumulated in the atmosphere eventually cools down due to the low temperatures found at high altitudes. These vapours become tiny droplets of water and ice, eventually coming together to form clouds.</p>

                    <span>4. Precipitation</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Above 0 degrees centigrade, the vapours will condense into water droplets. However, it cannot condense without dust or other impurities. Hence, water vapours attach itself on to the particle’s surface. When enough droplets merge, it falls out of the clouds and on to the ground below. This process is called precipitation (or rainfall). In particularly cold weather or extremely low air pressure, the water droplets freeze and fall as snow or hail.</p>

                    <span>5. Infiltration</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Rainwater gets absorbed into the ground through the process of infiltration. The level of absorption varies based on the material the water has seeped into. For instance, rocks will retain comparatively less water than soil. Groundwater can either follows streams or rivers. But sometimes, it might just sink deeper, forming aquifers.</p>

                    <span>6. Runoff</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">If the water from rainfall does not form aquifers, it follows gravity, often flowing down the sides of mountains and hills; eventually forming rivers. This process is called runoff. In colder regions, icecaps form when the amount of snowfall is faster than the rate of evaporation or sublimation. The biggest icecaps on earth are found at the poles.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p>All the steps mentioned above occur cyclically with neither a fixed beginning nor an end.</p>

                    <h3>How is Water Returned Back to the Oceans?</h3>
                    <span>According to the Water Science School (2018). The water cycle is the major source of returning water back to the oceans. The process occurs in the following ways:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The water cycle begins in the oceans.</li>
                        <li>The sun heats the water in the oceans.</li>
                        <li>The water evaporates as water vapours into the air.</li>
                        <li>The ice and snow sublimate directly into vapour.</li>
                        <li>The evaporated water from the oceans along with the water that transpired from the plants rises up in the atmosphere with the air currents.</li>
                        <li>These vapours condense into clouds that move around the globe by air currents.</li>
                        <li>The particles of the cloud grow, collide and fall out of the sky as precipitation.</li>
                        <li>Some precipitation falls as snow that accumulates as glaciers and ice caps that can store frozen water for several years.</li>
                        <li>The rest falls as rain into the oceans or on the land.</li>
                        <li>The water from the land flows into the rivers, ponds and lakes that eventually fall into the oceans.</li>
                        <li>This is how the water is returned back to the oceans.</li>

                <h3>Water in Daily Life</h3>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The following diagram illustrates the breakdown of water usage in a typical household, highlighting the various activities that contribute to our overall consumption. From flushing toilets and taking showers to washing clothes and using faucets, each percentage reveals how integral water is to our routines. By examining this data, we can identify opportunities to use water more efficiently and ensure its availability for future generations. Sikhwal & Aurisicchio (2023)</p>

                <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;">
                    <div style="width: 70%; margin: auto;">
                        <p>Toilet (24%): The toilet accounts for the largest share of household water use. Each flush requires a significant amount of water, making it a major contributor to daily consumption.</p>

                        <p>Shower (20%): Showers are the second-largest water use category. The duration and flow rate of the showerhead can greatly impact how much water is used during this time.</p>

                        <p>Faucet (19%): Water usage from faucets includes drinking, cooking, and washing hands. This category highlights our daily activities that require quick access to water.</p>

                        <p>Clothes Washer (17%): Washing machines also use a considerable amount of water per load. The type of machine and the settings chosen can influence overall consumption.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Leaks (12%): Surprisingly, leaks can waste a significant amount of water if not addressed. Even small leaks can add up over time, contributing to overall water loss in the home.</p>
                
                <p>Other (8%): This category encompasses various other uses, such as watering gardens, filling pools, or cleaning. While individually these uses may seem minor, they collectively add to our daily water footprint.</p>
